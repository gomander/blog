# My crusade against big tech

It was a great couple decades, growing up in Silicon Valley and seeing all the big tech companies around me flourishing and striving for greatness. Unfortunately, as I've grown and matured, I've been forced to confront the fact that these companies pursue profit over all else. They will drive humanity to the brink of extinction if it makes next quarter's profits go up by even the smallest amount. They fuel fascism (particularly in the USA) because it's what makes them the most money. This has finally driven *me* mad, and I've decided to ditch as many of these services as possible.

This does mean that most of the services I'm going to mention are either free and open source but require self-hosting, or paid services replacing previously free ones. These trade-offs won't be worth it for everyone, but they certainly are for me. I'll mention for each service the monetization model and where it's based.

## Desktop operating system

The first and biggest change I made was ditching Microsoft Windows for Linux. With the continued enshittification of Windows and increasing frequency of anti-consumer decisions about the direction of the operating system, I decided it was time for a change. My PC's operating system had changed from being a piece of software that improved my experience to being an advertising platform selling my attention and my data, despite still being a paid product. I found this completely irreconcilable.

In 2024, I first started experimenting with Linux on a home server for self-hosting some services, as well as in WSL for Rust development. However, as Microsoft continued to do things that pissed me off, I finally installed Linux on my main PC in early 2025, and was using it as my daily-driver operating system by the middle of the year. I've tried multiple different Linux distributions, including Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, NixOS, and CachyOS, but I won't go into too much more detail about that here. That deserves its own post. At the time of writing, I have been using CachyOS for about six months, and I'm very happy with it and not planning to switch any time soon. All mentioned Linux distros are free and open-source, with contributors around the globe.

## Email and calendar

More recently, I've decided to begin migrating my entire life off the Google suite. That includes the Gmail address I've been using for most of my life. The replacement I've chosen is Proton, a Swiss company, and it has seriously impressed me thus far. It uses a subscription model. The thing with creating a paid service in a market that's dominated by a competitor who offers their service for free* is that you actually need to make your serice worth paying for. If you've ever heard the quote by Gabe Newell about having to make a service that was so convenient that people were willing to pay instead of pirate, it's the same idea.

Proton walked me through setting up my own custom domain email address, and pointed out all potential issues and gave very good instructions on how to fix them. This was something that I was completely unable to figure out in Gmail. SPF, DKIM, and DMARC were just never quite right, but Proton got me up and running perfectly within minutes. I've also been using their calendar, password manager, authenticator, and VPN, as they're included in the subscription. Those have all seriously impressed me as well.

## Web search engine

Searching the web back in 2015 was great. Google was awesome (as long as you had an ad-blocker), and were wary of potential scam sites. However, in more recent years, it has become increasingly enshittified with more advertisements, more scam sites, advertised scams, AI slop results, AI slop summaries, and now a full-on "AI mode". Gross.

Enter Kagi. It's a small-ish US-based company. It's pretty much exactly what Google used to be, but better in every way. It has the high-quality search results. It has the quality-of-life features like regional search, scholar search, advanced image filters, great additional site links, and many more things that I found lacking in other search engines I tried after Google. They also filter out AI slop and SEO spam, and even provide a "small web" search, where you might find sites like this one! It even has a bunch of Google's newer features like AI summaries, should you want them. Crucially, though, they are opt-in, rather than forced upon you.

Perhaps most importantly, you are the _customer_, not the _product_. There are no ads, there are no sponsored results. They don't sell your browsing habits. They understand that they are providing a service, and that if their users don't like it, it's trivially easy to go back to Google. They know that their product needs to genuinely be better than the alternatives, and that's what they've accomplished. All they ask is a few dollars a month, and that is something I will gladly pay.

## Web browser

I've been using Firefox for my entire adult life, and a large portion of my childhood. I have so many thoughts on this topic that I will have to write an entire separate post about it. I will expand on this section as well, though, soon.

## Music platform

Spotify has the music industry in a bit of a chokehold. It's no secret that they pay their artists pitifully little, allow AI slop, and platform fascists. Yet, it's the default platform. Users use it because it's convenient and has all their favourite artists. Artists are forced to use it because it has all the users. Yes, it's technically a Swedish company, but it's just as much a blight on the world as many of the American companies on this list.

I'm not going to pretend that there's an alternative that is just straight up better, but I'm pretty sure I've found the best one: Qobuz. They pay higher artist royalties, have a streaming platform and allow purchasing and downloading DRM-free music, have a fairly extensive selection, and don't run fascist ads or platform right-wing extremist podcasts. All this, for one measly dollar more. For me, that's absolutely worth it.

## To be continued...

Other things that I want to write about at a later date include Bunny, Obsidian, Audiobookshelf, and more.
