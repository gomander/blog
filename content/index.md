# Welcome to my blog!

::alert{color="yellow" icon="lucide:construction"}
This site is under construction!
::

I plan to upload some of my thoughts and ramblings about things I care about here, but I mostly created this website because I bought the `gunnar.computer` domain name and needed to put something here.

I'm a professional software engineer and a big nerd with big opinions.
