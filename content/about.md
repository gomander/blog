# About me

My name is Gunnar. I'm a Swedish American, born smack-dab in the middle of Silicon Valley, and for my entire life, I've been a big stinking *nerd*.

I'm a professional software engineer, specializing in web development. I maintain [Wheel of Names](https://wheelofnames.com), which is a web app that allows users spin a wheel to randomly select an item from a list. Wheel of Names gets over 500 000 unique users every day, and I strive to make the website the best it can be by implementing features and solutions based on user feedback.

In my free time, I like messing with my computer(s). When I was 14, I built my first computer, and have been upgrading and building computers for myself and others ever since. I also enjoy tinkering with software, like self-hosing services and tweaking my system configuration. In 2024 I installed Linux for the first time when setting up my home server, and in early 2025 I fully moved over to Linux on my main PC.

Another activity I spend a lot of time on is playing videogames of all sorts. In 2025, I played 43 new games, most of which had been on my backlog for years. Some of my favourite games of all time are Hades 1 & 2, Hollow Knight and Silksong, Journey, OneShot, Expedition 33, Hi-Fi RUSH, Split Fiction, and Tactical Breach Wizards.

I also enjoy listening to music. I have a particular fondness for listening to soundtracks from games, movies, and shows I like, plus a wide variety. I can't say that I have any specific genres I gravitate towards, but a few artists I like are half-alive, DEMONDICE, Juniper Vale, Fox Stevenson, and Porter Robinson.

One last hobby of mine is listening to audiobooks. I'm a big fan of being able to experience a story without needing to sit there and put my full focus into it. I get anxious if I'm ever just doing one thing, as it feels like I'm wasting time. My favourite genres are sci-fi and fantasy, and some of my favourite authors are Andy Weir, Brandon Sanderson, and Janci Patterson.

Lately, I've been going on a crusade against big tech. You can read about that [here](/my-crusade-against-big-tech).
